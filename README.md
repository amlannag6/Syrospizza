# Syrospizza
A demo website for a Local Pizza store 
Syros Pizza is one of the long term and well known pizza chains in kamloops. They  are originally named as “Syros Pizza Spaghetti & Steak House Ltd”. Recently the owner got changed. New owner wants to build a good brand value throughout the online platform . So he wants to build a website also and an App for the Pizza store. For information , i have designed this company's new logo and started running their Facebook business page . By this project the website would be a prototype and as per user feedback and owner prospective the main website would be built. Due to limited resources multiple pizza and icon pictures will be used from royal free sources online.
